<h1 align="center"> How It's Made </h1>
Tech Used: C#, Blazor Web App (.NET)

<br></br>
<h1 align="center"> Inspiration </h1>
This project is inspired by the experience of my wife and I working through her cancer diagnosis and always having communication issues / information disconnects with the medical team. We were at the regional University Hospital that had the best team, but due to an overburdened medical system and the natural friction
that occurs on teams, we encountered a lot of friction in knowing what was going on. I want this project to empower patients to learn more about their circumstances, relieve their pain points in communication, as well as provide a relief to the medical team's burden to keep patient's constantly performed in an already overwhelming environment.

<h1 align="center"> Lessons Learned </h1>
This project taught me a lot about the extent of what JavaScript can do. The fine tuning of animations and event handlers can really bring a website to life and provide an incredible user experience.
<br></br>
I also learned about statis site generation and the reusable bits of code that can be paired with your "front matter" to create a streamlined code base for future content additions. -->
